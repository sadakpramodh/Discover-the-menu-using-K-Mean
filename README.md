# Discover the Menu using K-Means

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage K-Means clustering to uncover meaningful patterns and groupings within restaurant menus. By analyzing menu items, we aim to identify clusters of similar dishes, which can provide valuable insights for menu optimization, customer preferences, and culinary trends.

## Key Steps:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather menu data from various restaurants or cuisines.
   - Extract relevant information such as dish names, ingredients, descriptions, and prices.

2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the menu text:
     - Remove special characters, punctuation, and numbers.
     - Convert text to lowercase.
     - Tokenize menu items into individual words.

3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Represent menu items as feature vectors:
     - Utilize techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (e.g., Mini-LM-L6 LLM model).
     - Transform textual data into numerical representations.

4. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Apply K-Means algorithm to group similar menu items:
     - Determine the optimal number of clusters (K) using techniques like the elbow method or silhouette score.
     - Assign each menu item to a cluster.

5. **Interpretation and Insights**:
   - Explore the resulting clusters:
     - Analyze the characteristics of each cluster (e.g., common ingredients, cuisine types).
     - Identify popular dishes within each cluster.
     - Understand customer preferences and potential menu improvements.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize the clusters:
     - Plot menu items in a reduced-dimensional space (e.g., using PCA or t-SNE).
     - Highlight cluster boundaries and centroids.

## Expected Outcomes:

- **Clustered Menu Groups**:
  - Discover distinct groups of menu items (e.g., appetizers, desserts, vegetarian dishes).
  - Uncover hidden patterns and associations.

- **Menu Recommendations**:
  - Suggest menu modifications based on cluster insights.
  - Propose new dish combinations or seasonal specials.

- **Enhanced Customer Experience**:
  - Improve menu navigation for customers.
  - Personalize recommendations based on individual preferences.

## Conclusion:

The "Discover the Menu using K-Means" project bridges data science and gastronomy, offering a fresh perspective on culinary offerings. Whether you're a restaurant owner, chef, or food enthusiast, this project provides a delightful exploration of flavors and creativity.

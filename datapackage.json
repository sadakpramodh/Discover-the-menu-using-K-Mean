{"name":"data-society_discover-the-menu","title":"Discover The Menu","description":"Data includes 45,000 menus from the 1840s to the present.\n\n## Data generated through NYPL's crowdsourcing project *What's on the menu?*\n\nHere you will find The New York Public Library's transcribed historical restaurant menus, dish by dish, so that they can be searched by what people were eating back in the day. With approximately 45,000 menus dating from the 1840s to the present, The New York Public Library’s restaurant menu collection is one of the largest in the world, used by historians, chefs, novelists and everyday food enthusiasts. \n\nThe New York Public Library’s menu collection, housed in the Rare Book Division, originated through the energetic efforts of Miss Frank E. Buttolph (1850-1924), who, in 1900, began to collect menus on the Library's behalf. Miss Buttolph added more than 25,000 menus to the collection, before leaving the Library in 1924. The collection has continued to grow through additional gifts of graphic, gastronomic, topical, or sociological interest, especially but not exclusively New York-related. The collection now contains approximately 45,000 items, about quarter of which have so far been digitized and made available in the [NYPL Digital Gallery](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/the-buttolph-collection-of-menus#/?tab=about).\n\nThe Rare Books Division of The New York Public Library houses approximately 200,000 titles, covering five centuries of printing—from the 1450s to the present—and representing Continental Europe, England, and the Americas.\n\nThere's a lot of data behind What's on the Menu?: a mix of simple bibliographic description of the menus (created by The New York Public Library) and the culinary and economic content of the menus themselves (transcribed by volunteers).\n\nFor more information about each file, check the ```readme.txt```.\n\n__These data are updated on the 1st and 16th of every month.__\n\n## License\n\n> No known copyright restrictions on this material.
